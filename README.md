# ZB4199 Final Year Project: <br/> Deep Learning and The Diffusion Partial Differential Equation from simulated data of Drosophila embryos.

The code repository for Python programmes used for the Final Year Project (FYP).

## 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Python programming language version: 3.7.4.
2. Tensorflow version: 1.14.0.
3. Numpy version: 1.17.5.
4. Scikit-learn version: 0.22.1.
5. Pandas version: 1.0.0.
6. DeepMod (written in Tensorflow, Python): https://github.com/PhIMaL/DeePyMoD. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
